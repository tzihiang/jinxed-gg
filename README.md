#Jinxed.gg

Jinxed.gg is my own personal website that fetches summoner information in real-time. This is a work in progress and is meant for my own learning.
Only the src folder is shown here for my own commits. The other files not commited on git are the standard django files.

The library used to fetch the data is made by myself: https://github.com/tzihiang/RiotAPI/tree/master/LoLScripts, which is also a wrok in progress

Technologies used: Django, Bootstrap, Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript
